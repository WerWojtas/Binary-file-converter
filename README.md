# Binary-file-converter</br>
This text file converter utilizes the Huffman algorithm to convert files into binary sequences.</br></br>
Utilizing a binary format can significantly reduce the storage space required, especially for lengthy text files.</br>
Files description:
<ul>
    <li>'text_file - this is the file you wish to convert into binary format.</li>
    <li>prefixes - this is the file that contains prefixes. You don't have to download this file, converter will create one for
    your text.</li>
    <li>bin_file - this is your binary file. This file will be created out of prefixes and your text in c++ function</li>
</ul>
Make sure you will place huffman_algorithm.py and text_file in the same directory, C++ function don't have to be with theese two. Change the path to your files in C++ function and replace text in text_file with yours. Run algorithm on that file, it will create prefixes, next run C++ function, it will code your next to binary_file. If you want to decode, you can run decoding function in huffmann_algorithm.py after you made previous operations.
